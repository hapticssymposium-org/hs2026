## Description

In summary, the aim of this CCC is deepening understanding of softness perception and widening engineering applications, as well as sharing unsolved problems related to these fields. Earlier research inside and outside the community have deepened the understanding and application of softness and soft matters, which is a major component of haptic perception and determines the value of a daily product and human friendliness of man-machine interfaces and robots. For example, it is now shared in the community that softness is the result of neural integration of surface and deep sensory organs. Nonetheless, very recently, important findings, such as factors influencing individual distinctions of softness judgment and softness illusions due to surface shapes have been emerging. Cross-modal effects between softness perception and other sensory cues is also an aspect that was missed by earlier research. Further, a fundamental question was raised whether or not softness is an independent perceptual element through a comparison between humans and robots, i.e., machine learning. Even the most basic concept of softness differs among different cultures, suggesting that we should cast a doubt on even the definition of softness. Hence, softness perception has yet to be fully understood. Softness perceived by humans is not a function of the inverse of mechanical stiffness. Classical push-in tests relying on the surface displacement of a target object and reaction force is imperfect for estimating human’s sense of softness. Softness sensors following the humans’ tactile information processing has been actively studied. Softness is also a key to developing physically and emotionally friendly machines and man-machine interfaces. Comfortable haptic interaction requires materials and mechanical design that enable soft contact.

## Call for individual contributions

We seek attendee contributions to be presented as a poster or demonstration in an interactive session. To submit a poster or demo proposal, please send a title and 500 word abstract discussing how your work in haptics links to the theme of this cross-cutting challenge. We especially invite submissions from people with disciplinary backgrounds underrepresented in the haptics community. ~~Applicants must be a faculty member and/or a researcher holding a Ph.D. degree or equivalent.~~

Please submit your proposal by ~~February 9, 2024~~**February 16, 2024 (extended)** by emailing the organizers ([okamotos@tmu.ac.jp](mailto:okamotos@tmu.ac.jp), [gg7h@virginia.edu](mailto:gg7h@virginia.edu)).
