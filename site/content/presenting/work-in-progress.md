# Work-in-Progress (WIP) Papers

Work-in-Progress papers enable authors to share late-breaking results with the research community. The emphasis of WIP papers is on the novelty of the work, not completeness.

## Important Dates

* January 31, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): WIP paper submission deadline
* February 16, 2024: WIP acceptance notification
* March 1, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): WIP final paper submission
* March 18, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): 30sec preview video submission

## Preparing your Submission

### Paper Format

WIP papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors’ convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

### Program Abstract

At submission, **an abstract (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) is also required**. Similar to technical papers, this abstract is for use in the conference program. Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters. Unlike the technical papers, the WIP abstract is required at initial submission.

### Paper Length

WIP papers should be **maximum 2 pages** including references. There will be no option to purchase additional pages.

### Author Names and Affiliations

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner. Author names and affiliations should be specified on all WIP papers.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

We strongly encourage authors to prepare an accessible manuscript for all submissions, as reviewers may have accessibility needs. We also encourage authors to use inclusive language. See [Accessibility](../accessibility).

### Submission Method

All WIP papers (including optional video) should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

### Publication
All accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings, but they will not be published in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp).

Authors retain the full copyright of WIP papers so that they can submit a more mature version of the paper at another time.

### Videos

See [Supplemental Videos](/presenting/work-in-progress/#supplemental-videos)


### Final Submission

All accepted WIP Papers will appear in this year’s Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be electronically distributed at the conference, but will not be submitted to IEEE Xplore. The authors of accepted WIP Papers will be asked to prepare a final version of their paper, the 100-word abstract, and a final version of the optional video.

## Presenting at the Conference

Work-in-Progress papers will be presented through a poster and an optional  preview video submitted before the conference. WIP authors may also optionally opt-in to a new mentorship program (see below).

### WIP Posters

The WIP posters will be presented during a WIP poster session 5:00 to 6:30pm on Monday, April 8. Posters have a maximum dimension of **48” tall x 36” wide (121.92cm x 91.44cm)**, recommended to be in **portrait layout**. The posters can be designed using any size, orientation, or format, as long as they fit within this allocated space. You are encouraged to include the [conference logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cy713kmBjW3uK2710KcFry7e3SNQPFQW/view?usp=sharing).

Authors are responsible for printing their own poster and bringing it to the conference. Pushpins will be provided to install the posters on the poster boards. The posters must be installed during the hour preceding the WIP poster session, between 4:30 and 5:00pm on Monday, April 8. The posters must be taken down after the WIP Poster session, between 6:30 and 7:00 pm. A storage space will be available for authors who wish to leave their poster in storage during the day on Monday, April 8.

Any questions about WIP papers can be addressed to the WIP chair (Oliver Schneider) at [wip@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:wip@hapticssymposium.org).

### Mentorship Program

To provide additional mentoring to authors of Work-in-Progress papers, we created a system where authors can sign up for mentors to come to their poster session and talk to them about their work and career. 

* If you are a student submitting work to WIP and would like a mentor to stop by your poster please fill out the form below:
  * [https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9](https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9) 
* If you are a faculty member, industry professional, or postdoctoral scholar, you can sign up to offer mentorship to a WIP author. The commitment for mentoring a WIP author would include reading their WIP paper, stopping by their poster, and having a 10-15 min conversation about their work and career. To sign up as a mentor, please fill out the form below:
  * [https://forms.gle/xiwQjMBz33uvZckX8](https://forms.gle/xiwQjMBz33uvZckX8)

## Videos

Authors of accepted Work-in-Progress Papers are strongly encouraged to submit each of two types of video: (1) Supplemental Videos (providing information beyond what is included in the paper) and a (2) 30-second Preview Video, to be shared on social media. Submissions are optional, but strongly encouraged as a means of highlighting the paper to interested researchers, including those who may not attend the conference.


### Supplemental Videos

Submission of a video is optional but encouraged to help readers understand the WIP paper. Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper. Videos associated with accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and may be used to promote the conference.

#### Supplemental Videos Guidelines

* Format: .mp4 (mpeg-4))
* Length: up to 60 seconds
* Resolution: at least 480p (progressive scan)
* File size: up to 40 MB
* Address the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility))

### Preview Videos

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Preview videos provide symposium attendees with a chance to browse papers in advance.

The WIP preview video should focus on the main ideas or results of the work. The purpose is to encourage the audience to visit the WIP poster, not to summarize the paper contents.

#### Preview Videos Guidelines

First, authors must prepare: (1) a video file; (2) a closed caption file; and (3) metadata for YouTube. Then, authors must complete [this form](https://forms.gle/9FjQ1k1jNYqXzRt76) where they will be requested to upload their files and enter their metadata.

The preview video deadline is **March 18, 2024**. 

**1. Prepare a Video File**

* Screen and audio configuration
    * Recommended: full-screen slides/video clips, with optional picture-in-picture or side-by-side video of the presenter
    * Acceptable Alternative: full-screen slides/video clips with audio of the presenter
    *	Use a high-quality microphone for the recording. Most headset microphones work well. Avoid using the microphone that is integrated in your computer.
*	Video specifications
    *	Length: Up to 30 seconds
    *	Resolution: At least 720p and 30 fps (preferably 1080p or more, and 60 fps)
    * Use [YouTube supported file formats](https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en)
    * Adhere to the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility)) 

**2. Prepare a Closed Caption File**
