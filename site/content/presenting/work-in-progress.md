# Work-in-Progress (WIP) Papers

Work-in-Progress papers enable authors to share late-breaking results with the research community. The emphasis of WIP papers is on the novelty of the work, not completeness.

## Preparing your Submission

### Important Dates

* January 31, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): WIP paper submission deadline
* February 16, 2024: WIP acceptance notification
* March 1, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): WIP final paper submission
* March 18, 2024 (11:59 pm PST): 30sec preview video submission

### Paper Format

WIP papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors’ convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

### Program Abstract

At submission, **an abstract (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) is also required**. Similar to technical papers, this abstract is for use in the conference program. Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters. Unlike the technical papers, the WIP abstract is required at initial submission.

### Paper Length

WIP papers should be **maximum 2 pages** including references. There will be no option to purchase additional pages.

### Author Names and Affiliations

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner. Author names and affiliations should be specified on all WIP papers.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

We strongly encourage authors to prepare an accessible manuscript for all submissions, as reviewers may have accessibility needs. We also encourage authors to use inclusive language. Details will be posted on the website.

### Submission Method

All WIP papers (including optional video) should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

### Publication
All accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings, but they will not be published in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp).

Authors retain the full copyright of WIP papers so that they can submit a more mature version of the paper at another time.

### Videos

Submission of a video is optional but encouraged to help readers understand the WIP paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos associated with accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 60 seconds), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB).

We strongly encourage authors to follow video accessibility guidelines for their submission, especially, having captioning and voice-over. Details will be posted on the website.

### Final Submission

All accepted WIP Papers will appear in this year’s Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be electronically distributed at the conference, but will not be submitted to IEEE Xplore. The authors of accepted WIP Papers will be asked to prepare a final version of their paper, the 100-word abstract, and a final version of the optional video.

## Presenting at the Conference

Work-in-Progress papers will be presented through a poster and an optional  preview video submitted before the conference. WIP authors may also optionally opt-in to a new mentorship program (see below).

### WIP Preview Videos

Authors have the option to submit a 30 second preview video in advance of the conference. This video will be posted at our [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ieeehapticssymposium8182) for viewers to watch in advance of the conference. 

The WIP preview video should focus on the main ideas or results of the work. The purpose is to encourage the audience to visit the WIP poster, not to summarize the paper contents.

### WIP Posters

The WIP posters will be presented during a WIP poster session 5:00 to 6:30pm on Monday, April 8. Posters have a maximum dimension of **48” tall x 36” wide (121.92cm x 91.44cm)**, recommended to be in **portrait layout**. The posters can be designed using any size, orientation, or format, as long as they fit within this allocated space. You are encouraged to include the [conference logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cy713kmBjW3uK2710KcFry7e3SNQPFQW/view?usp=sharing).

Authors are responsible for printing their own poster and bringing it to the conference. Pushpins will be provided to install the posters on the poster boards. The posters must be installed during the hour preceding the WIP poster session, between 4:30 and 5:00pm on Monday, April 8. The posters must be taken down after the WIP Poster session, between 6:30 and 7:00 pm. A storage space will be available for authors who wish to leave their poster in storage during the day on Monday, April 8.

Any questions about WIP papers can be addressed to the WIP chair (Oliver Schneider) at [wip@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:wip@hapticssymposium.org).

### Mentorship Program

To provide additional mentoring to authors of Work-in-Progress papers, we created a system where authors can sign up for mentors to come to their poster session and talk to them about their work and career. 

* If you are a student submitting work to WIP and would like a mentor to stop by your poster please fill out the form below:
  * [https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9](https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9) 
* If you are a faculty member, industry professional, or postdoctoral scholar, you can sign up to offer mentorship to a WIP author. The commitment for mentoring a WIP author would include reading their WIP paper, stopping by their poster, and having a 10-15 min conversation about their work and career. To sign up as a mentor, please fill out the form below:
