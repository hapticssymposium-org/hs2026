# IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Papers

_More information is available at [https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh). For any questions, please contact [Ilana Nisky_](mailto:program@hapticssymposium.org), Program Chair of the Haptics Symposium. See below for Frequently Asked Questions._

The 2024 Haptics Symposium will again feature a IEEE Transactions on Haptics journal track. Papers accepted to this track will be presented at the conference and simultaneously published as short papers in IEEE Transactions on Haptics. These papers are up to 6 pages in length, including references.

Authors can submit their 6-page paper via the [Transactions on Haptics website](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh) by selecting the "Short paper (ToH-Haptics Symposium 2024)" paper type during the submission process. Papers should be prepared using [the formatting instructions for Short Papers](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh#shortpapers) provided by the Transactions on Haptics. Each paper will be reviewed by Transactions on Haptics reviewers and an Associate Editor. The outcome of the first round of reviews will be "accept", "revision", or "reject". For papers receiving a decision of “revision” after the first review round, _authors will need to submit a revision within 21 days for a second review_, which may result in a decision of “accept” or “reject.” If the decision after the Transactions on Haptics review is “accept,” the paper will be included in the conference and simultaneously published in the journal.

## Important Dates

* September 25, 2023 (firm): IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper deadline
* February 5, 2024: Deadline for authors to submit IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper information to PaperPlaza for the conference program
* March 18, 2024: IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper preview video deadline


**IMPORTANT CHANGE THIS YEAR:** In order to streamline the editorial process, papers that are not accepted as ToH Short Papers after a single round of revision will not be subsequently considered for publication as a Conference Technical Paper. Additionally, authors of papers that are not accepted as ToH Short Papers after a single round of revision will have the option to continue the review process through the standard ToH Short Paper review process and timeline, or to withdraw their paper from consideration entirely.

Authors choosing not to submit via the new journal track may still submit their papers directly to the conference. Such papers will be reviewed following the established conference technical paper review procedure. Accepted conference technical papers will be published in the conference proceedings and IEEE Xplore.

## Final Submission

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program. The authors of accepted ToH Short Papers will use the [PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net/) to provide information about their paper for inclusion in the conference proceedings. We have provided details below on how to submit your accepted ToH Short Paper content to PaperPlaza.

**Before February 5, 2024**, the submitting author must submit a “first submission” for their ToH Short Paper to the “IEEE Trans. Haptics Short Paper” track on [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/). The submitting author will be asked to enter the following information:

* The paper title, list of authors, PaperPlaza PIN numbers of all authors, and keywords.
* An abbreviated abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words).

The PDF of the ToH Short Paper and optional supplemental video are not required at this time. These files will be obtained directly from the IEEE Transactions on Haptics for inclusion in the conference proceedings.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to [ras.101@papercept.net](mailto:ras.101@papercept.net). General questions about the final submission of ToH Short Papers for the conference proceedings should be sent to the Publications Chair at [publications@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:publications@hapticssymposium.org). Other general questions related to conference programming should be sent to the Program Chair at [program@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:program@hapticssymposium.org) or the General Co-chairs at [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

## Presentation and Publication

All accepted ToH Short Papers will be presented in-person orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session. At least one author must register for the conference by the Early Bird registration deadline (February 23, 2024) and make plans to attend the conference. Papers will not be allowed to be presented virtually.

All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

## Videos

Authors of accepted ToH Short Papers are strongly encouraged to submit each of two types of video: (1) Supplemental Videos (providing information beyond what is included in the paper) and a (2) 30-second Preview Video, to be shared on social media. Submissions are optional, but strongly encouraged as a means of highlighting the paper to interested researchers, including those who may not attend the conference.

### Supplemental Videos

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the ScholarOne Manuscripts system (Transactions on Haptics Short Journal Papers) and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference. Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

#### Supplemental Videos Guidelines

* Format: .mp4 (mpeg-4))
* Length: up to 2 minutes
* Resolution: at least 480p (progressive scan)
* File size: up to 40 MB
* Address the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility))
* Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance

### Preview Videos

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Preview videos provide symposium attendees with a chance to browse papers in advance.


#### Preview Videos Guidelines

First, authors must prepare: (1) a video file; (2) a closed caption file; and (3) metadata for YouTube. Then, authors must complete [this form](https://forms.gle/9FjQ1k1jNYqXzRt76) where they will be requested to upload their files and enter their metadata.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

_**What is the submission deadline?**_

The submission deadline is September 25, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. Anywhere on Earth. This deadline is firm.

_**What is the maximum number of pages?**_

Papers should be 6 pages or less, including references and all other components of the paper. 1 or 2 extra pages (beyond 6 pages) may be added for a fee of $200 per page.

_**How should I submit my paper?**_

Please submit your paper using ScholarOne Manuscripts as described on the [IEEE Transactions on Haptics website](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh). When asked for the Manuscript type, please select the "Short paper (ToH-Haptics Symposium 2024)" option.

_**What template should I use?**_

Your paper must be formatted using the templates provided by the Transactions on Haptics. See the formatting instructions under Template for Short Papers in the [Submission Procedures](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh#shortpapers) of the Transactions on Haptics. Please note that the template has changed this year.

Please also note that some links on the Transactions on Haptics website are currently broken. While this issue is being resolved, please find below a copy of the formatting instructions with corrected links:

_When using the IEEE style format, the first (title) page will contain the paper title and each author's name, affiliation, and full address (mailing address, email address, and fax number), with the corresponding author clearly indicated, the abstract (no more than 200 words), the keywords (index terms), and the beginning of the main text of the paper. Do not use a cover page_

<!--
_**Will I need to resubmit my paper to the conference if it is rejected by the journal?**_

All papers that are rejected by the journal after the first or second round of reviews will automatically be sent, along with their reviews, to the Conference Editorial Board (CEB) of the Haptics Symposium to be considered for publication in the conference proceedings and presentation at the conference.
-->

_**Will it be possible for me to submit an extended version of my paper to the IEEE Transactions on Haptics at a later date?**_

Short papers that are accepted by the journal will be published in the journal. It will therefore be impossible to publish an extended version of the work in the journal in the future.

## Presentation Instructions

Each ToH short paper will be presented by one author in a twelve-minute talk, followed by a two-minute Q&A session. We will strictly adhere to this schedule, with fifteen minutes allocated for each talk, including one minute for presenter changes.

All presentations will be delivered from the presenter's own computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. An HDMI connection will be available. Although HDMI adapters will be provided on-site, presenters are encouraged to bring their own adapters that work for their computers.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the [detailed conference program](../../program/oralsessions)  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information).

Before their session, presenters are advised to test the connection with the conference projection system, ensuring all videos play correctly on the screen. Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.
