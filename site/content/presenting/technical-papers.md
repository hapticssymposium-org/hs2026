**Important Update:** Authors affected by time zone discrepancy please contact us by sending an email request to</br> [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:chairs@hapticssymposium.org) and [editors@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:editors@hapticssymposium.org).

## **Notification Date**

Wednesday, December 20, 2023

## **Submission Method**

All technical papers (with optional videos) should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl) (submission system will be open one month prior to the deadline).  Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2024" Conference, and "Haptics 2024 Technical Papers" Track. 

## **Presentation and Publication**

All accepted technical papers will be presented in-person orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session. At least one author must register for the conference by the Early Bird registration deadline (February 23, 2024) and make plans to attend the conference. Papers will not be allowed to be presented virtually.


All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

Paper decisions will be announced in late December, and will also be available in [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

## **Videos**

Authors of accepted Technical Papers are strongly encouraged to submit each of two types of video: (1) Supplemental Videos (providing information beyond what is included in the paper) and a (2) 30-second Preview Video, to be shared on social media. Submissions are optional, but strongly encouraged as a means of highlighting the paper to interested researchers, including those who may not attend the conference.

### Supplemental Videos

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the the PaperPlaza system and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference. Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

#### Supplemental Videos Guidelines

* Format: .mp4 (mpeg-4))
* Length: up to 2 minutes
* Resolution: at least 480p (progressive scan)
* File size: up to 40 MB
* Address the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility))
* Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance

### Preview Videos

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Preview videos provide symposium attendees with a chance to browse papers in advance.


#### Preview Videos Guidelines

First, authors must prepare: (1) a video file; (2) a closed caption file; and (3) metadata for YouTube. Then, authors must complete [this form](https://forms.gle/9FjQ1k1jNYqXzRt76) where they will be requested to upload their files and enter their metadata.

The preview video deadline is **March 18, 2024**. 

**1. Prepare a Video File**

* Screen and audio configuration
    * Recommended: full-screen slides/video clips, with optional picture-in-picture or side-by-side video of the presenter
    * Acceptable Alternative: full-screen slides/video clips with audio of the presenter
    *	Use a high-quality microphone for the recording. Most headset microphones work well. Avoid using the microphone that is integrated in your computer.
*	Video specifications
    *	Length: Up to 30 seconds
    *	Resolution: At least 720p and 30 fps (preferably 1080p or more, and 60 fps)
    * Use [YouTube supported file formats](https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en)
    * Adhere to the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility)) 

**2. Prepare a Closed Caption File**

See [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#closed-caption).

**3. Submission**

To complete your submission, upload the video file and closed caption file, and enter the metadata on [this form](https://forms.gle/9FjQ1k1jNYqXzRt76). The instructions for metadata are as follows.

## **Final Submission**

**The final submission deadline is January 22, 2024.**

All accepted technical papers will appear in this year’s Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program and the archival IEEE proceedings. As such, authors will work within the established infrastructure of the [PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net/). To minimize confusion, we have provided details below on how to submit your accepted conference technical paper content to PaperPlaza.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to [ras.101@papercept.net](mailto:ras.101@papercept.net). General questions about the final submission of conference technical papers should be sent to the Publications Chair at [publications@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:publications@hapticssymposium.org). Urgent general questions should be sent to the Program Chair at [program@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:program@hapticssymposium.org) or the General Co-chairs at [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

### Camera-ready Instructions

Please follow these instructions if your paper was submitted directly as a Technical Paper.

Refer to the PDF Accessibility and Video Accessibility guidelines detailed at [Guide to Inclusive and Accessible Submissions](../accessibility).

The corresponding author must submit the final camera-ready conference technical paper content to the “Technical Paper” track.

The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the final submission. If there are any issues, PaperPlaza staff will contact the corresponding author.

* The title, author list, and keywords should be correct and final.
* The abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) should be finalized. Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters.
* Author affiliations, required ethical statements for experiments with human subjects, and funding acknowledgements should be checked.
* The final camera-ready pdf manuscript file of up to 10 MB must be uploaded.
* Authors are requested to revise their manuscripts according to reviewer guidance.
* Authors may optionally upload a final camera-ready video file. Please see the “Video” section for more details.
* IEEE requires a plain text Readme file of up to 10 kB for any accompanying multimedia content, such as video. The Readme file must contain (1) An overall description of the video file, (2) Multimedia player information, and (3) Author contact information.
* IEEE requires a plain text Summary file of up to 10 kB for multimedia content. The Summary file must describe in 5 sentences or less the contents of the video. This file helps IEEE Xplore users to make downloading decisions.


## Presentation Instructions

Each technical paper will be presented by one author in a twelve-minute talk, followed by a two-minute Q&A session. We will strictly adhere to this schedule, with fifteen minutes allocated for each talk, including one minute for presenter changes.

All presentations will be delivered from the presenter's own computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. An HDMI connection will be available. Although HDMI adapters will be provided on-site, presenters are encouraged to bring their own adapters that work for their computers.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the [detailed conference program](../../program/oralsessions)  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information).

Before their session, presenters are advised to test the connection with the conference projection system, ensuring all videos play correctly on the screen. Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.
