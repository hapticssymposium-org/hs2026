### **Oral Presentation Videos** (Required for participation in the virtual symposium)

Authors of accepted papers are required to submit oral presentation videos of their papers. The 3-minute videos will be disseminated via the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and will be organized into thematic playlists reflecting the conference program.

All contributed video presentations will be eligible for the conference Best Video Presentation Award, which will be announced during the live streaming event on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.

First, authors must prepare: 1) a video file; 2) a closed caption file; and 3) metadata for YouTube. Then, authors must complete [this form](https://forms.gle/9njssbsRotjc34f6A) where they will be requested to upload their files and enter their metadata.

### Preview Videos (New for 2022; Optional, but strongly encouraged)

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw), and may be used to promote the conference.

**The preview video deadline is March 1, 2022.**

Please refer to the "Oral Presentation Video Instructions." **The length of the preview video should not exceed 30 seconds.**

### Video Accessibility

Providing alternative means of accessing information is valuable for people with sensory impairments and also enables engagement in a variety of contexts (e.g., if the video is muted). We request that authors utilize both written text and recorded narration to explain their videos. To support meeting participants with visual impairments, please describe all figures and images with sufficient detail.

If you have questions or need assistance with any of these activities, please reach out to the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Chairs <mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org>.

<!--
When creating videos, authors should include both captions and recorded narration.

For Oral Presentation Videos and Preview Videos, authors may use YouTube’s automatic closed captioning functionality, but should review and edit the closed captions for accuracy after they are generated.

For Supplemental Videos, authors should directly “burn” closed captions into the video due to technical limitations in IEEE Xplore. In other words, these captions are not provided as a text file, but rather as subtitles in the video itself (this is called “open captioning”, rather than “closed captioning”, because the captions are always visible).

If you have questions or need assistance with any of these activities, please reach out to the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Chairs <mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org>.

 so that their descriptions can be captured by closed captioning software.
