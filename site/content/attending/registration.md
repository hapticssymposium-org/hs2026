Please read the following **before** you begin the registration process:

## Conference registration will require the following:

* *IEEE account username and password*, as appropriate. Your user credentials will be used to verify IEEE membership and eligibility for discounted IEEE member rates during the registration process. If you do not have your user credentials, please follow the instructions listed under the FAQs tab on the registration page to recover your IEEE username and password.
* *Registration discount code*, as appropriate. All requests for discount codes should be submitted via email to the Haptics Symposium Registration Chair ([registration@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:registration@hapticssymposium.org)) with the subject HAPTICS Discount Code Request. Requests should include the registrant's name and the type of discount code being requested.
* *Titles of the accepted* short papers, technical papers, work-in-progress papers, hands-on demonstrations, and/or cross-cutting challenges that you will be presenting. All accepted papers, posters, demos, and cross-cutting challenges must be presented in person.
* *Payment of extra page charges*, as appropriate. If the camera-ready version of your technical paper exceeds six pages, you will be charged $200 for each additional page, up to two pages. Failure to pay the additional page fees will prevent the publication of your paper in the archival IEEE conference proceedings.

## Conference Registration includes:

* Attendance at all Haptics Symposium activities, including cross-cutting challenges, podium presentations, poster presentations, hands-on demonstrations, and exhibits.
* Access to various mentoring activities such as resume database, WIP mentoring, and early investigator lunch. Sign up for these activities on the [mentoring page](https://2024.hapticssymposium.org/attending/mentoring/)
