## Plenary Session

**Tuesday, March 22, 2022 - 9am to 12pm US Pacific Time (16:00 to 19:00 UTC)**

The 2022 virtual conference will be highlighted by a live event that will feature video presentations of papers, together with live panel discussions with authors, awards, and information about future conferences.  The event will be freely accessible to everyone and may be viewed via the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw), where it will also be archived for later viewing.  It will mirror the previous 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium live streaming video event, which remains available via the conference YouTube channel, where it has been viewed several thousand times.

## Cross-Cutting Challenges Live Video Event

**Wednesday, March 23, 2022 - 9am to 12pm US Pacific Time (16:00 to 19:00 UTC)**

The 2022 IEEE Haptics Symposium will also feature two Cross-Cutting Challenge (CCC) sessions whose topics were selected based on an open solicitation for proposals.  The CCC sessions will include keynote presentations and panel discussions addressing challenges of broad interest to the haptics research community.  They will take place during a live streaming video event that will be freely accessible to everyone and may be viewed via the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw), where it will also be archived for later viewing.

## Online Video Presentations

As in 2020, we are pleased to offer an online video forum for authors of accepted papers to present their contributions to a broad audience. All authors of accepted technical papers and IEEE Transactions on Haptics short papers will be invited to create 3 minute video presentations of their work.  The collection of video presentations will be shared via the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw), and will also be available via the [conference program](/program/VideoPresentations).  This content will provide a valuable resource for people around the world to learn about new trends and findings in haptics, and for the contributions from the conference to be disseminated widely via the internet.

Authors of accepted papers will be contacted with further information and instructions for preparing their video presentations and participating in the live streaming video event. One author of each accepted paper will be required to register for the conference (at a substantially reduced rate).  

## New: IEEE Haptics Symposium Mentoring Forum

We all benefit from mentoring and networking to get started in our careers. For the 2022 conference, we are pleased to offer a new [Mentoring Forum](/program/Mentoring-Forum) that will provide opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to connect with senior and early-career faculty, to participate in breakout group discussions about their research via an online forum, and to formulate a concrete plan of action for advancing their research and career goals.  Students and postdoctoral researchers who are interested in participating will be asked to submit a short document describing a research idea, preliminary results, or a proposed study.  A detailed call for participation, including information about how to submit, will be provided via email and via the IEEE Haptics Symposium website in the near future.
