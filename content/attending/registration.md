Please read the following **before** you begin the registration process:

## Conference registration will require the following:

* *IEEE account username and password*, as appropriate. Your user credentials will be used to verify IEEE membership and eligibility for discounted IEEE member rates during the registration process. If you do not have your user credentials, please follow the instructions listed under the FAQs tab on the registration page to recover your IEEE username and password.
* *Registration discount code*, as appropriate. IEEE member rates apply to both IEEE members and IEEE Technical Committee on Haptics (TCH) members. TCH members who are not also IEEE members should obtain a discount code prior to completing their online registration in order to obtain IEEE member rates. All requests for discount codes should be submitted via email to the Haptics Symposium Registration Chair ([registration@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:registration@hapticssymposium.org)) with the subject HAPTICS TCH Discount Code Request. Requests should include the registrant's name and the type of discount code being requested.
* *Titles of the accepted* short papers, technical papers, work-in-progress papers, hands-on demonstrations, and/or cross-cutting challenges that you will be presenting. All accepted papers, posters, demos, and cross-cutting challenges must be presented in person.
* *Payment of extra page charges*, as appropriate. If the camera-ready version of your technical paper exceeds six pages, you will be charged $200 for each additional page, up to two pages. Failure to pay the additional page fees will prevent the publication of your paper in the archival IEEE conference proceedings.

## Conference Registration includes:

* Attendance at all Haptics Symposium activities, including cross-cutting challenges, podium presentations, poster presentations, hands-on demonstrations, and exhibits.
* Access to various mentoring activities such as resume database, WIP mentoring, and early investigator lunch. Sign up for these activities on the [mentoring page](../mentoring/)

## One-day Registration includes:

* One-day registration includes participation in the evening event (i.e., opening reception, or WIP poster session, etc.) taking place on your chosen day. Due to the high cost of attendance, registration on April 9 does not include a banquet ticket.

## Reduced Registration Fees

In an effort to assist anyone who would like to attend the 2024 IEEE Haptics Symposium, we are offering reduced registration fees based on World Bank country classifications. The World Bank uses four categories according to each country's gross national income per capita: high income, upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income. We are offering three categories for 2024 IEEE Haptics Symposium registration: (i) high income, (ii) upper middle income, and (iii) lower middle income and low income.

If you would like to take advantage of the reduced registration fee program, please go to the [World Bank website](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) and locate the classification for the country in which you are currently working or attending school. When registering you will be instructed to enter your current mailing address.
