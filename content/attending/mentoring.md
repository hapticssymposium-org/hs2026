# Mentoring Activities

The Haptics Symposium conference acknowledges the valuable role of mentoring in the personal and professional development of students and researchers in the haptics community. We are committed to providing mentorship opportunities for this year’s conference attendees. To that end, we have created the following programs.

## Resume Database

We have created a database of resumes for people seeking career opportunities in academia or industry. This database can be accessed by our industry sponsors and members who have open job offerings. The database is created and shared before the conference. The conference will not keep the resumes after the completion of the conference.
* If you are looking for a job or internship and wish to submit your resume, please fill out the form below:
  * [https://forms.gle/dtHHvZt9JM1LLpoY8](https://forms.gle/dtHHvZt9JM1LLpoY8)
* If you wish to gain access to the resume database, please submit the following form:
  * [https://forms.gle/yajVjmdoKFuLtQng7](https://forms.gle/yajVjmdoKFuLtQng7)

  Note: Only companies or individuals who are looking to hire can get access to the database.

## Mentoring for Work-In-Progress Papers

To provide additional mentoring to authors of work in progress papers, we created a system where authors can sign up for mentors to come to their poster session and talk to them about their work and career. 
* If you are a student or postdoctoral scholar submitting work to WIP and would like a mentor to stop by your poster please fill out the form below:
  * [https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9](https://forms.gle/9xW8kgjeedQQmpUq9) 
* If you are a faculty member, industry professional, or postdoctoral scholar, you can sign up to offer mentorship to a WIP author. The commitment for mentoring a WIP author would include reading their WIP paper, stopping by their poster, and having a 10-15 min conversation about their work and career. To sign up as a mentor, please fill out the form below:

## Early Investigator Lunch

To provide early investigators the opportunity to network with their peers, we will have an Early Investigator Lunch for professionals in industry or academia who are within 10 years of their PhD graduation. If you are interested in attending this event, please fill out the form below:
