IEEE Haptics Symposium features a diverse technical and social program to present your latest research and engage with the haptics community. 

The 2024 conference will be held in sunny Southern California at the Hotel Maya in Long Beach. The venue offers oceanfront views, a man-made beach, and a resort-style atmosphere. A short distance south of Los Angeles, Long Beach is known for its waterfront attractions, aquarium, pedestrian-friendly downtown, and large port. One week after the end of the conference, the city will host the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Many attractions and tourist destinations throughout Southern California, including theme parks and outdoor recreation, are easy to reach from the conference venue. 

Long Beach can be easily accessed via multiple airports, including the Long Beach Airport (LGB), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), John Wayne Airport (SNA), Ontario International Airport (ONT), and Bob Hope Airport (BUR).
