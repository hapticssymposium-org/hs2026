# IEEE Transactions on Haptics Posters
Authors of articles recently published in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics (ToH) are invited to present their work during a joint poster session, featuring recent ToH and Work-In-Progress (WIP) publications. The poster session is planned as a single-track session, scheduled for the second day of the conference, and will not be held in parallel with any podium or demonstration sessions. This is a great opportunity for journal authors to engage with other scientists and reach a larger audience. 

## Important Dates

*	January 31, 2024: ToH poster submission deadline
*	February 16, 2024: ToH poster acceptance notification
* March 18, 2024: ToH poster preview video deadline

## Participation Criteria

*	The invitation is open for all articles that have been or will be published in the [IEEE Transactions on Haptics](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4543165) in 2023 (Volume 16, issues 1-4) as well as ToH articles that become available on IEEE Xplore via [Early Access](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4543166) prior to the application deadline.
*	Articles reporting research that was presented at a conference in an earlier form may (and are encouraged to) participate in this poster session. However, manuscripts that have been presented during a ToH poster session at a prior haptics conference are not permitted to participate.
* At least one of the article’s authors must register for the conference by the early-bird registration deadline (February 23, 2024) [full conference registration or at least the day of the poster session, which is Monday, April 8th].

## Submission Method

*	To participate, one author must forward the full citation of their IEEE Transactions on Haptics article to the ToH posters chair ([tohp@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:tohp@hapticssymposium.org)) by 11:59 p.m. PT on January 31, 2024. Please coordinate the poster submission with all paper authors to avoid duplicate submissions.
*	Each submission will be acknowledged by a confirmation email within five business days of submission.
*	In the unlikely event that there is insufficient space, articles published in 2023 will be given priority over Early Access articles.
*	Acceptance in the poster session will be confirmed by February 16, 2024.

## Preview Videos

Authors of accepted ToH poster are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Preview videos provide symposium attendees with a chance to browse papers in advance.


### Preview Videos Guidelines

First, authors must prepare: (1) a video file; (2) a closed caption file; and (3) metadata for YouTube. Then, authors must complete [this form](https://forms.gle/9FjQ1k1jNYqXzRt76) where they will be requested to upload their files and enter their metadata.

The preview video deadline is **March 18, 2024**.

## Presentation Instructions

*	All ToH posters will be presented during a joint ToH and Work-In-Progress (WIP) poster session that will take place between 5:00 and 6:30 pm on Monday, April 8th.
*	The ToH and WIP poster session will be held as a single-track event and will not be held in parallel with any podium or demo sessions.
*	Presenters are responsible for the design and printing of their paper’s poster, which will be displayed on shared poster stands (with two posters per side) provided during the session. The maximum single poster size must fit within a portrait-oriented rectangle with dimensions of 36 inches (91.44 cm) in width by 48 inches in height (121.92 cm). Poster design, style, and formatting is at the discretion of the presenter.  Presenters are encouraged to include the conference logo.
*	Presenters must install their posters during the half-hour preceding the ToH poster session, between 4:30 and 5:00 pm on Monday, April 8th.
