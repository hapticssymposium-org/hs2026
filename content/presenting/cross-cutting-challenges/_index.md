## Information about the Cross Cutting  Challenges Track

Following their successful launch in 2018, **Cross-Cutting Challenges (CCC)** will be held again at the 2024 Haptics Symposium. The goal of a CCC is to create a space where researchers can come together to focus on interdisciplinary challenges calling for united solutions from the haptics community. Drawn from an open solicitation, two CCCs will be selected. These will feature keynote talks and interactive discussions delivered by researchers spanning a range of expertise, from science, engineering, design, and beyond.

## Cross-Cutting Challenge Proposals

~~Wednesday, September 27, 2023~~ **Wednesday, October 25, 2023 (extended)** - Proposal deadline

An exciting CCC proposal introduces an interdisciplinary challenge that calls for united solutions. Proposals for CCC are solicited from the community of researchers in the field of haptics and beyond. While the traditional three areas covered in haptics relate to science, technology and applications, CCCs will be selected such that researchers from each of the aforementioned areas can present in the same session. For example, a CCC might explore challenges that connect the next generation of mobile user interfaces with challenges in surface haptics/conformable displays, leveraging insights from those working on the measurement of finger pad skin properties to surface interaction, those working on new dielectric polymer technologies, and those working on human computer interaction concepts detailing how a consumer would utilize such capability. Other CCCs might relate to soft and flexible touch interfaces, ubiquitous computing, medical user interfaces, gaming, and mixed, virtual, and/or augmented reality. Examples of past successful CCCs include [Touch and embodiment](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/program/ccc-theme1/), [Integrating wearable haptics and real-world touch](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/program/ccc-theme2/), [Affective haptics](https://2020.hapticssymposium.org/program/ccc-theme-1-feeling/), [Skin as medium of communication](https://2020.hapticssymposium.org/program/ccc-theme-2-communication/), [Expanding sensory interactions](https://2018.hapticssymposium.org/ccc1), and [Haptic dimensions of surfaces](http://2018.hapticssymposium.org/ccc2).

**Submission:** Email your submission as a single PDF to ccc@hapticssymposium.org. The proposal should include the following items:
1. **Title**
1. **Organizer list:** Name and contact information of the organizer(s) (maximum of 3).
1. **Context & motivation (up to 500 words):** Provide context & motivation for your CCC (e.g., briefly mention key current and past works and future perspectives that relate to the arc of research in the topic area).
1. **Format of your CCC (bullet list agenda):** Describe the format in which your CCC would take place, e.g., indicate what types of activities (e.g., keynotes, interactive sessions, etc.) you would like to feature and envisioned speakers and presenters (note these are just representative as they help the selection committee understand the type of speakers and presenters you plan to host).

We encourage organizers to contact the CCC Chairs (ccc@hapticssymposium.org) ahead of the submission deadline to inform them of their intention to submit and ask any questions they may have.

### Recommended Format for your CCC

Each CCC will have a program that spans multiple sub-activities, for instance, (1) introductory words by organizers, (2) keynotes from speakers in the area (aim for a diversity of opinions, including industry, engineering, perception, design, etc.); (3) posters or demos, (4) interactive discussions; (5) panels with real-users; and many other possible formats. More information on the types of activities can be found below:

**Keynotes:** Investigators will apply to deliver keynote talks in your CCC (we recommend not more than 4 to 5 keynote speakers per CCC). Note that, typically, a CCC's organizer will automatically be a keynote speaker, unless they for some reason chooses otherwise.

**Interactive discussions:** There are many activities that make a CCC more interactive (i.e., sessions in which the attendees will not only be listening to a keynote speaker, etc.). Some examples of past successful interactive sessions include: (1) panels (e.g., a lively moderated discussion with several experts and Q&A with audience), (2) poster/video sessions with individual presenters or teams (e.g., audience engages with presenters in groups around their posters). Other formats are possible and the CCC Chairs are open to your proposals of what makes for a good interactive session. Similar to keynote speakers, investigators will apply to be part of your interactive session.

### Selection process for CCCs

**Selection Committee:** The CCCs will be selected with the help of a committee that consists of two academic members and two representatives from industry. The committee members will be chosen by the CCC Chairs to represent haptic science, applications, and technology.

**Evaluation criteria:** The committee is looking for CCC proposals that are exciting and fit a broad audience at the conference. Moreover, the multidisciplinary aspect is highly valued, e.g., proposals are recommended (but not required) to aim to include perspectives and speakers from a number of angles within haptics, such as human-computer interaction (e.g., human factors, design), end-users (e.g., domain experts, real end-users), contextual/historical perspectives (e.g., experts that can provide an overview of the history of technologies), and industry (e.g., company representatives, engineers, etc.). Furthermore, it is also highly desired that topics and participants span countries and even continents.

## Open Call for Individual Contributions

~~February 9, 2024~~**February 16, 2024 (extended)** - Individual submission deadline

**Individual Submission Instructions:** CCC calls for individual submissions are now open. The selected CCCs will feature interactive sessions that individuals can apply to join. This may include submitting a poster or demonstration, as indicated on the CCC’s call. Submissions may be led by a researcher with support from other researchers from their team. 

Note that while CCC organizers may want to encourage particular individuals to submit, the selection of contributors within a CCC will ultimately be based on finding a representative and coherent cohort of presenters that together create a powerful narrative and inspiring call to action. ~~Applicants must be a faculty member and/or a researcher holding a Ph.D. degree or equivalent.~~ **While faculty members and industry researchers are encouraged to present a summary of their work related to a CCC’s theme, individual contributions from students and researchers will also be accepted.**
