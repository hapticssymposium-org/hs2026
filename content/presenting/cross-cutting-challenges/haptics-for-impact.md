# Cross-Cutting Challenge 
Haptics for Impact: Consumer Value, Ethics, Diversity

## Organizers

* Margot Racat, IDRAC Business School
* Manuel Cruz, Innovobot
* Oliver Schneider, University of Waterloo

## Description

Haptics is a rapidly growing field with many new devices, software technologies, and psychological insights. In the meantime, public awareness has increased, with media portrayals like Ready Player One and high-profile consumer devices incorporating haptics, such as smartphones, laptops, and game controllers. Moreover, societal changes like social distancing and remote work have also highlighted our need for touch in life and work. Yet, we still face the cross-cutting challenge of understanding the value of haptics for society and business. As we seek to understand the value of haptic technology, ethical concerns immediately arise around issues of consent, influence, accessibility, privacy, and agency. We also see challenges surrounding the diversity of people who would experience haptics.

Recent work has started to show how haptic technologies can contribute to improved user and consumer experience. Studies have shown that haptics can modify user experience measures, for instance, improving customer's interactions by providing a more realistic, and enjoyable digital experience. As a consequence, consumers feel more engaged with brands and have an increased intention to purchase and pay. Higher engagement with brands is not the only benefit of such technologies, however: importantly, a richer and more interactive digital experience has also given rise to better education and higher engagement with social causes.

We propose to **bring the haptics community together with business and humanities scholars** to critically examine the impact haptics can have in peopleâ€™s day-to-day lives, the ethics surrounding haptic technology use, and the impact of culture and diversity on those experiences. This cross-cutting challenge will take an interdisciplinary approach to think about three key aspects of sensory-enabling technologies surrounding the sense of touch:

* **Consumer value:** Haptics can bring value to individuals in many ways, in very direct ways (training and simulation, rehabilitation) and less obvious ways (consumer experience, social connection). We challenge the community to think broadly about what value their work can bring to people, and how to measure it.
* **Consumer ethics:** As haptic technology is increasingly incorporated into consumer technology, it becomes more critical to think about ethical considerations around competing organizational and individual goals. We aim to discuss issues about consent, influence, accessibility, privacy, agency, and other concerns involving technology-mediated touch.
* **Consumer diversity:** Touch is for everyone, as a fundamental way for people to understand their world, whether it is a physical, digital, or social environment. We hope to discuss how diverse backgrounds, capabilities, and cultural contexts influence haptics, and motivate the need for personalization and adaptability. We seek to explore the interaction between these goals and the emerging standardization of haptic technology.

The challenge will involve three invited speakers on our three themes (consumer value, ethics, diversity), and then include an interactive poster session for attendees from different backgrounds to connect and discuss the challenge. We will conclude with reflection from the organizers on how to continue work on this challenge after the workshop.

## Call for individual contributions

We seek attendee contributions to be presented as a **poster in an interactive session**. To submit a poster proposal, please send a title and 500 word abstract discussing how your work in haptics links to the three main themes: consumer value, ethics, diversity. We especially invite submissions from people with disciplinary backgrounds underrepresented in the haptics community, including **business, social sciences, humanities, and liberal and fine arts**. Engineers and scientists are also very welcome to present their work by linking it to the challenge themes. ~~Applicants must be a faculty member and/or a researcher holding a Ph.D. degree or equivalent.~~

Please submit your proposal by ~~February 9, 2024~~**February 16, 2024 (extended)** by emailing the organizers ([margot.racat@idrac-bs.fr](mailto:margot.racat@idrac-bs.fr), [mcruz@innovobot.com](mailto:mcruz@innovobot.com), [oliver.schneider@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:oliver.schneider@uwaterloo.ca)).
