# Student Volunteer Program

We are looking for student volunteers (SVs) to help us run the 2024 IEEE Haptics Symposium.

## Important Dates

* Student Volunteer Applications Due: January 19, 2024
* Notifications: February 2, 2024
* Conference: April 7-10, 2024, in Long Beach, CA, USA

## General Information

We are recruiting a team of enthusiastic, reliable students who will help us host and manage a successful, productive, and enjoyable conference. The Student Volunteer (SV) program is an excellent opportunity for young researchers to familiarize themselves with state-of-the-art haptics research. It also allows enthusiastic students to establish and expand their network with the most relevant academicians, professionals, and other students in the field. 

A wide range of responsibilities will be assigned to SVs, such as:
* Support at the registration desk
* Badge checks for technical sessions, demos, reception, and banquet
* Help set up and maintain demos, posters, and exhibits
* Audio and video support during oral sessions
* Help members of the organizing committee with other tasks

In general, no special skills are required except for a few positions where we are looking for individuals with good photography, social media, or A/V skills. Each volunteer is required to commit to approximately 12 hours total, spread across 2 to 4 days of the conference (April 7-10), and attend a student volunteer orientation the night before the conference (April 6).

## Benefits

Student volunteers will receive a full student registration for the entire Symposium, valued at $437, for their time and immeasurable efforts. This registration includes free access to the entire conference, including cross-cutting challenges, technical sessions, demo and poster sessions, the welcome reception, and the banquet. Free participation in the conference will allow  SVs to learn about haptics and talk to individuals from a broad range of academic and industrial backgrounds.

If you are a student applying to be a student volunteer, please do not register for the conference until you have heard whether you were selected for an SV spot. Student volunteers are responsible for their own travel and lodging expenses throughout the conference. Lunch will be provided to volunteers on days that they work.

## Requirements

Student volunteers are required to attend all four (4) days of the conference, should have a positive "can do" attitude,  and good communication skills in English. Applicants must be an undergraduate or graduate student during the 2023-2024 academic year. 

Volunteers are required to show up 5-10 minutes before their allotted service times and be available to help out for unforeseen surprises, which are difficult to predict. We expect every volunteer to commit to a total of approximately 12 volunteer hours of work during the conference.

There will be an SV orientation on the evening of April 6th. Volunteers must plan to attend the orientation to meet with the Student Volunteer Chairs prior to their assignments. If you require a special exception to your arrival/departure times, please note this in your application; only a small number of exceptions can be made.

Responsibilities and time allotments during the conference will be sent to the SVs a few weeks before the start of the conference.
