# Awards

Three main awards were distributed at IEEE Haptics Symposium 2024 to honor top contributions in each of the main categories of publications: IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Papers, IEEE Haptics Symposium Conference Technical Papers, and Hands-on Demonstrations. Commendations were also conferred for outstanding reviewing of technical paper submissions.

The details of each award appear below. All winners were announced during the award ceremony on April 10, 2024.

## Best IEEE Haptics Symposium Conference Technical Paper

36 contributions were published as technical papers. The IEEE Haptics Symposium 2024 Editorial Board nominated six papers for this award based on the strength of their reviews.

A committee of three experts (Jee-Hwan Ryu, Yasamin Vardar, and Vincent Levesque) reviewed the nominated papers, reviews, and oral presentations. They selected one Best Paper, one Distinguished Paper (formerly "runner up"), and one Honorable Mention.

### Best Paper

**SkinSource: A Data-Driven Toolbox for Predicting Touch-Elicited Vibrations in the Upper Limb**  
Neeli Tummala, Gregory Reardon, Simone Fani, Dustin Goetz, Matteo Bianchi, and Yon Visell

### Distinguished Paper

**A Transparent Hydraulic Actuator to Visualize Finger Pad Deformation at Programmable Material Compliances**  
Bingxu Li, Alton Sharpe, and Gregory Gerling

### Honorable Mention

**Design and Characterization of Particle Jamming-Based Variable Stiffness Displays Using Non-pneumatic Actuators**  
Joshua Brown and Fernando Bello

## Best IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper

18 contributions were published in the short papers category in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics (ToH). The IEEE ToH Editorial Board nominated six papers for this award based on the strength of their reviews.

A committee of three experts (Lynette Jones, Hannes Saal, and Matteo Bianchi) reviewed the nominated papers, reviews, and oral presentations. They selected one Best Paper, one Distinguished Paper (formerly "runner up"), and one Honorable Mention.

Haokun Wang, Yatharth Singhal, Hyungki Son, and Jin Ryong Kim

## Outstanding Reviewers

The Haptics Symposium publication process critically depends on careful and constructive expert review of submitted manuscripts. Individuals who reviewed IEEE Transactions of Haptics Short Papers were eligible for the journal's annual reviewing awards, while individuals who reviewed at least one technical paper submission were eligible for this commendation from the conference.

After the review of all technical papers were complete, the IEEE Haptics Symposium 2024 Editor-in-Chief, Ingvars Birznieks, invited all members of the Program Committee to nominate reviewers for this prize. From this list, the Conference Editorial Board agreed on selection criteria, and chose three for recognition, each of whom reviewed 3 or 4 papers.

* **Sarah McIntyre**, Linköping University
* **Simone Fani**, Arizona State University
* **Yusuke Ujitoko**, NTT Communication Science Laboratories
