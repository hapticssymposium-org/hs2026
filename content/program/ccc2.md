## Description

Haptics, the science of touch and its application in technology, is experiencing rapid growth, driven by advances in devices, software, and a deeper understanding of its psychological impacts. The societal shifts towards social distancing and remote work have further underscored the importance of touch in both personal and professional contexts. Despite its growing presence, challenges remain in fully understanding haptics' societal and business value, including ethical issues related to consent, influence, accessibility, privacy, and the need to cater to a diverse user base.

Recent research underscores haptic technology's potential to enhance user experience, improve customer engagement, and foster deeper connections with brands and social causes through more immersive and interactive digital experiences. This CCC is a call for the haptics community, business, and humanities scholars to collaborate, critically examining haptics' impact on daily life, its ethical implications, and how culture and diversity affect user experiences. This interdisciplinary effort aims to address three core aspects: the broad value haptics can offer to consumers, ethical considerations as haptic technology becomes more prevalent in consumer products, and the importance of accommodating diverse user experiences. This proposed initiative includes talks on these themes and interactive sessions to foster dialogue among participants, concluding with reflections on continuing these explorations beyond the workshop.
